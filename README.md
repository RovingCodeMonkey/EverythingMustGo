# React + TypeScript + Vite

Play project to tinker with setting up react,

The Plan.

Fascilitate my potential near future move by allowing me to display items for sale.

Build out a static site that can be hosted in S3, 
load a list of items containing Price, Description, Images from a csv and display them for sale.
Possibly build in a grouping or bulk sale price mechanism.

App Tasks
- [x] An app that builds into static html - so no server required.
- [ ] Displays priced items as list with title/price/single picture,
- [ ] Allows user to view more information via a details link(Redux or Context?)/popup (State?).
- [ ] Do I try and index it? Short time-window is there any point?

Server tasks
- [x] Turn bucket into static site folder
- [x] Configure namecheap dns to point to site
- [x] Set up github actions to automatically deploy to s3 either on update of main or manual action.
